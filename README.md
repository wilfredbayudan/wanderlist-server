## Usage

### Routes
* `/` - **Homepage**

The homepage renders a collection of markers on a map generated by MapBox. Each marker represents a destination that has been added to a bucketlist. Clicking on a marker will reveal a popup with additional details for the destination, as well as the ability to 'like' it.

* `/bucketlists` - **Bucketlists**
